# Communication Device for Autistic Child

The page will contain touch buttons that play recorded audio of words. This like "I Want" "Don't Want" "Mom" "Finn" "Dad" and so on. It should also include a few buttons that are fun sound fx and vfx with no semantic meaning.

This child will approach this as a toy, but hopefully find they can communicate their thoughts in a rudimentary way.

The page should be as robust as possible about staying on the screen. If the child somehow dismisses the web page they will be unlikely to restore it.
